# Beckley ATC Simulation

A browser-based **air traffic control (ATC) simulation** system built using **Flask** and **Leaflet.js**. This project visualizes real-time plane/aircraft movement, simulates takeoff and taxiing logic, and includes features such as conflict detection, weather variation, and aircraft control via a web interface.

---

##  Features

- Aircraft control panel with **Taxi**, **Force Takeoff**, and **Force Landing** buttons.
- Real-time **aircraft simulation** with animated movement, altitude changes, and routing.
- Automatic **conflict detection** based on distance and altitude thresholds.
- Traffic log panel showing aircraft info and nearest aircraft distance.
- Modular architecture separating **backend simulation logic** and **frontend UI**.

---

## Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask** (for the backend API and routing)
- **JavaScript** with **Leaflet.js** (for interactive mapping)
- **HTML5/CSS3** (frontend UI)
